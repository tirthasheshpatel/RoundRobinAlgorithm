# Round Robin Algorithm

## Setup

```bash
# You can directly run the script
# There are no external deps
python3 osproject.py
```

### Implementation

We have implemented the Round Robin Algorithm proposed in the paper [A Comparative Analysis of Quantum Time based on Arithmetic, Geometric, and Harmonic Mean for Dynamic Round Robin Scheduling][1] as a animation in python to demonstrate real time scheduling. The Round Robin scheduling algorithm is commonly used in distributed or clustered systems like Google Colab and Amazon AWS to schedule the server requests.
